# Steerable Perlin Noise
To appear in SIGGRAPH Talks 2025

## Abstract

Perlin noise is an integral tool for generating procedural textures for computer graphics applications. It's widely used across multiple industries and applications due to its simplicity, speed and controllability. We present 2 simple changes to the Perlin noise algorithm that allows for anisotropy in the output noise. We believe these small adjustments open the door to new texturing workflows as well as simple vector field visualizations in multiple dimensions.
